This is our first project while studying on Codo a Codo 4.0 and the guidelines for this project are:


# The site must have:
- 4 pages or, in case of a landing page, 5 sections.
- Semantic HTML tags.
- Contact form with JS validation.
- At least 1 iframe, 1 Google font, 1 flaticon or fontawesome.
- At least 1 fully responsive page with 3 breaks for 3 different devices.
- Animation, transform or transition 
- Layout with Grid / Flex.
- API rest with JS.
- Can use bootstrap ( non-mandatory) only in the form section
